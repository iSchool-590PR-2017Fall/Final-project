Git-hub structure
"""
In the View python file, there is the whole project interface: Board_GUI.py file;
In the Model python file, MonteCarlo_play.py is the successful rules for tictactoe game; Easy_MCpaly.py , Hard_MCplay.py and Med_MCplay.py are three modes implementation; 
PartB.py is the Monte Carlo Simulation procedure file.
In the Controller python file, the Dialog.py is to give a mention of the game results.
In the icon file, it’s the button pictures for board.

Framework for the whole project
"""
This whole project is divided into two parts: 
1. human-computer interactive part
2. computer-computer Monte Carlo Simulation
For both parts, we are using MVC framework to distinguish GUI and algorithm parts. 
For the GUI part, we use PyQt5 as the front GUI design; and connect the signals with background slots. 
We use Monte Carlo Simulation to complete three Game Modes: Easy, Medium and Hard.
For Easy mode, the player(computer) will absolutely choose the random vacant position to put the chess; 
For Medium mode, it’s an almost-random decision procedure except when there is a chance to win, the player(computer) will choose to do this .
For Hard mode, there is an extra visual-selection, which means the computer will traverse all possible situations and score every possible step, finally choose the position of highest score.
