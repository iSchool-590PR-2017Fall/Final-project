## Project
### Background:
[Tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) is a world famous game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.

[Monte Carlo Simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) is a broad class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. 

*Our project* focuses on applying the Monte Carlo Simulation into training the machine to how to play tic-tac-toe _wisely_.

### Hypothesis:
+ [ ] **Absolute randomness** - For any specific situation, the machine will try any blank spot, with an absolute randomness. In our case, the decision is on the basis of the simulation, which is on and only on the basis of randomness.
+ [ ] **random variable series** - Each step will be a different situation which will call a MCS for the decision, and the whole game is based on the collabraton of all MCS.
+ [ ] **No human experiences involved** - The program contains the idea of Exhaustive Attack method and the spirit of traversal, on the other hand, no human experience of the game is needed.
+ [ ] **Back propagation** - Further algorithms helped to better abstract the decision from the simulation.

### Purpose:
 - We are ambitious enough to generate a human-computer interactive GUI medium for playing the game. The player can choose to play on the offensive position or the defensive position.
 
         

### Hypothesis before running the simulation:
  As there is no policy or strategy for Monte Carlo, it will randomly choose all possible positions. Human have policy to win, in this way, it will fail for many times.

### Simulation's variables of uncertainty
  There is no tactics for every round. In this way, all of the blank positions are available to choose. For every MC(Monte Carlo) layer (round), we set multiple moving probabilities as random variables.Expand next move from all of the possible positions, using Monte Carlo to simulate all rounds. For each result(win or lose or fair),  we use backpropagation to score every MC layer steps. And after many times simulations, we can get best policy for this game.
  #
  Round 1, there are 9 random variables(available positions);
  #
  Round 2, there are 7 random variables(available positions);
  #
  Round 3( expect result round), there are 5 random variables(available positions);
  #
  Round 4( expect result round), there are 3 random variables(availbale positions);
  #
  Round 5( expect result round), there is 1 position.
  #
  This is the whole possible procedure for Tic-tac-toe game, where it's a good representation of reality.

"""
List and describe your simulation's variables of uncertainty (where you're using pseudo-random number generation). 
For each such variable, how did you decide the range and which probability distribution to use?  
Do you think it's a good representation of reality?

## Instructions on how to use the program:
  This is a human-computer interaction game. The player will play with computer.For each round, player will react and make a decision for next step.
